				<em>There are a lot of things I like to do</em> I like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lego_Group>Legos.</a> When I was a child I used to spread my legos out on the floor and stepped on them till my feet died. I found it as a stress releiver because school becomes too much and just bulding a structure is very satisfying. When I was younger I used to trade legos for money. I had a little market in my elementary school classes. It sounds creepy and sketch but it was good as I gained experience at a young age.

			<h3>How did I sell legos?</h3>
			<p>
                To be honest, I manipulated my classmates into buying them and the money 
                I used went to food from the snack shack at my school. So when my parents saw the wrappers and I forgot to throw them away, I said that I am on student council and I get free snacks.

			 Geography was and still is one of my passions and in this picture, my awkward smile and nasty haircut showed how much of a nerd I was. As a young child, all I ever talked about was traveling the world and eating and meeting people. To prepare for that I looked through all of my geography books and atlas' and made sure I knew everything.</a>

			<h3>Geography</h3>

				<strong>I feel when you know geography, you gain an understanding of the world better than most people because you are then educated on those peoples cultures and where they live and if you go to that specific place, you can adapt to it easier. </strong>
